### What is the difference between the `STypes` and `Types` classes?

- The `Types` class represents the **Core Language**. These types are part of the internal implementation and should *
  *never be exposed** to the user.

- The `STypes` class represents the **Sugar Language** (also called the **Surface Language**). These are types that are
  safe to expose and interact with in external code or tooling.
